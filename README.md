# 📚 Programming Practice & Self-Assessment Repository

## 🚀 About This Repository

This repository is my **personal learning space** where I practice and improve my understanding of different programming languages and web technologies.

I use it to:

* Learn **core syntax and concepts**
* Practice writing small programs and assignments
* Make mistakes, fix them, and learn from them
* **Self-assess my progress at the end of each day**

This repo is focused on **learning by doing**, not on being perfect.

## 🧠 Languages & Technologies Covered

I actively practice the following:

* **C#** – Console applications, methods, logic, and problem solving
* **Python** – Syntax, statements, loops, and basic programs
* **C** – Functions, conditions, and low-level logic
* **JavaScript** – Syntax, variables, loops, functions, and objects
* **HTML** – Page structure, elements, forms, and semantics
* **CSS** – Styling, selectors, layout, and the box model

## 📝 Daily Self-Assessment

At the end of each day, I review:

* What I learned
* What confused me
* What I need to revisit
* What I can now explain without help

This helps me:

* Track progress
* Identify weak areas
* Build consistency and discipline

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals

* Understand programming **fundamentals**
* Write clean, readable code
* Become comfortable with syntax across multiple languages
* Build confidence through repetition and practice

---

## ⚠️ Important Note

This repository may contain:

* Beginner-level code
* Mistakes and experiments
* Multiple versions of similar solutions

That is **intentional** and part of the learning process.

## 🌱 Growth Mindset

> “Every error is a lesson.
> Every small win counts.”

This repo represents my journey from **confusion to clarity**, one day at a time.

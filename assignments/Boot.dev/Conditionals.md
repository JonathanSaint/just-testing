📝 Assignment Tasks
1️⃣ Comparison Operators

Create two number variables and compare them using the following operators:

==

===

!=

>

<

>=

<=

Print the result of each comparison to the console.

2️⃣ Basic if...else Condition

Create a variable called age.

If the age is 18 or older, print "You are allowed to vote"

Otherwise, print "You are not allowed to vote"

3️⃣ else if Condition (Grading System)

Create a variable called score (0–100).

Use if...else if...else to print:

"Grade A" for 80 and above

"Grade B" for 60–79

"Grade C" for 40–59

"Fail" for below 40

4️⃣ Logical Operators (&&, ||, !)

Create two boolean variables:

isLoggedIn

hasPermission

Use logical operators to:

Allow access only if the user is logged in AND has permission

Allow access if the user is logged in OR is an admin

Print the opposite of isLoggedIn using the NOT (!) operator

5️⃣ Nested Conditional Statements

Create a variable called temperature.

If temperature is above 30 → print "It's hot"

If temperature is between 20 and 30 → print "It's warm"

Otherwise → print "It's cold"

Use nested if statements.

6️⃣ Ternary Operator

Create a variable called isStudent.

Use a ternary operator to print:

"Student Discount Applied" if true

"No Discount" if false

7️⃣ Switch Statement (Day of the Week)

Create a variable called dayNumber with a value from 1 to 7.

Use a switch statement to print the corresponding day:

1 → Monday

2 → Tuesday

3 → Wednesday

4 → Thursday

5 → Friday

6 → Saturday

7 → Sunday

Include a default case for invalid values.

8️⃣ Switch Statement (User Role)

Create a variable called userRole with values such as:

"admin"

"editor"

"user"

Use a switch statement to print the access level for each role.

9️⃣ Nullish Coalescing Operator (??)

Create a variable called username that may be null or undefined.

Use the nullish coalescing operator (??) to:

Display the username if it exists

Otherwise display "Guest User"

🔟 Bonus Challenge (Optional)

Create a variable called balance.

If balance is null or undefined, default it to 0

If balance is greater than 0 → print "Balance Available"

Otherwise → print "No Balance"

Use nullish coalescing + conditionals.

# 📘 JavaScript Assignment: Objects & Conditions (Beginner)

## 🧠 Goal
This assignment will help you understand:
- JavaScript **objects**
- **if / else** conditions
- How missing or incorrect pieces can break your code

Read the code carefully and answer the questions **without running it first**.

---

## 🧩 The Code Snippet

```javascript
const user = {
  name: "Alex",
  age: 15
  isLoggedIn: true
};

if (user.age > 18) {
  console.log("Access granted");
} else if user.age < 18 {
  console.log("Access denied");
}
````

## ❓ Your Tasks

### 1️⃣ What is the **first error** you notice in the object?

* Look closely at how the object properties are written.
* Is anything missing between them?

✏️ **Write your answer here:**

---

### 2️⃣ The program throws an error before running the condition. Why?

* Does JavaScript understand the object as written?
* What rule of object syntax is being broken?

✏️ **Write your answer here:**

---

### 3️⃣ There is a problem in the `else if` statement.

* Compare it to how an `if` statement is written.
* What is missing for it to work?

✏️ **Write your answer here:**

---

### 4️⃣ The program checks age, but something important is ignored.

* There is a property in the object that is never used.
* What is it?
* How *could* it be used in a condition?

✏️ **Write your answer here:**

---

### 5️⃣ Bonus Challenge 🌟

Modify the logic so that:

* Access is granted **only if**

  * The user is logged in
  * AND the user is 18 or older

You don’t have to write the full code — just explain **what condition is needed**.

✏️ **Write your answer here:**

---

## 🧪 Think Like a Programmer

Before fixing code, always ask:

* ❓ Does JavaScript understand every line?
* ❓ Are all brackets, commas, and parentheses present?
* ❓ Are all conditions written correctly?

---

## 🏁 Submission

Write:

* What was **wrong**
* What was **missing**
* What was **needed for it to work**

No pressure — mistakes are part of learning 🚀
